He hated this part of town. The lower levels were always damp, smelling of ozone and cheap noodles.</p><p>\"You got the drive?\" the contact asked, his face hidden in the shadows of a flickering hologram advertisement.</p><p>\"I got it,\" Jack replied, patting his pocket. \"But the price just went up.\"</p><p>The contact laughed, a harsh, metallic sound. \"You think you're in a position to negotiate, kid?\"</p><p>Jack smirked. \"I know I am. Because I know what's on this drive. And so do you.\"</p>",
